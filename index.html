        <h2 class="section-heading">Where are they?</h2>

<p>
  You sit comfortably on your couch and pick up your phone. You scroll through
  the latest TikTok trend, past that funny Reel about Gen-Z humor. You snug into
  a blanket, ready to dive into the new 20 min episode by 3Blue1Brown on 'Why PI
  Is Everywhere'. Once on YouTube, though, you get sidetracked by a Short of
  Elon taking a puff with Joe Rogan, and you end up irritated by a Vox
  documentary on the Rise to Power of Vladimir Putin. You stop and think: Where
  are the cute kittens? How long were they absent in my recommendations?
</p>

<p>
  In its 18-year history, YouTube has become the undisputed king of online
  video. As of 2022, YouTube is the second biggest social media in the world,
  with over 2.5 billion active users, who watch hundreds of hundreds of millions
  of hours of content every single day. The company rose like a rocket ship
  after its founding in 2005 by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim, who
  were all early employees of PayPal, and was bought by Google 18 months later.
  Under Google, YouTube went from being a repository of amateur video to a
  powerhouse of original content, not to mention a launching pad for its own new
  brand of superstars, like PewDiePie and the Smosh Brothers. The increase in
  users is directly proportional to the increasing number of video content
  uploaded on YouTube. This has become a place for everyone to compete in
  creating video content and earning income from uploaded videos. We would like
  to explore the path of Youtube to be the second most visited site in the
  world.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
  To explore YouTube's trends over the years, we will travel through time using
  the part of the YouNiverse Dataset that consists ofEnglish-content video
  metadata for over 72.9M videos, including descriptions, tags, numbers of
  likes, views, etc
</p>

<hr />

<h2 class="section-heading">Our idea</h2>

<p>
  We want to focus on the trends over the years of existing YouTube in a format
  of evolution. To understand where we were and are now
  (https://www.versionmuseum.com/history-of/youtube-website). From the nostalgic
  cute kittens short videos to professional content creators with a global
  audience and incredible production quality making a real impact on topics like
  political rivalries, product reviews and scientific education. What content
  became a part of our school of life, and how do people operate the platform in
  recent years?
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Our Analysis</h2>

<h3 class="analysis-question">
  How much information are we actually looking through on YouTube?
</h3>

<p>
  In April 2011, James Zern, a YouTube software engineer, revealed that 30
  percent of videos accounted for 99 percent of views on the site. This fact
  corresponds to the notion of trends on YouTube. So, let's derive this point
  and look at the timeline of how many percent of videos on YouTube were
  responsible for 99% of views on the platform for other years.
</p>

<b>-figure goes here-</b>

<p>
  As we can see even in the first years of existing the platform the whole
  content wasn't covered by the viewers and with time this percentage was fixed
  at over 28-32% of videos that were responsible for 99% of views. Indeed,
  recommendations play a pivotal role across our entire community, introducing
  viewers to content they love and helping creators connect with new audiences.
  The main issue of advantage is that you will never be faced with a minority of
  content on your recommendation page. And will never see extreme content
  because YouTube more generally reflects personal preferences that can be seen
  across their online habits. We digress â€¦
</p>

<p>
  The additional question arises: What is the behavior of the duration of videos
  over the years, so that it changes the number of views? Wow! Everything tends
  to be longer! The simplest explanation for these swelling run times is a
  straightforward business. As a study <b>-add link here-</b> from the Pew
  Research Center demonstrates, YouTube has been quietly shifting its
  recommendation system to reward lengthy videos.
</p>

<h3 class="analysis-question">
  What can reveal positiveness in the content? Is hate paid in another
  situation?
</h3>

<p>
  The classification of positive and negative content becomes very important for
  the YouTube user to assess how meaningful the content that has been published
  is based on user opinion. A large following to a YouTube channel gives enough
  power to the content creator to manipulate the video and reach a thousand
  users. As anyone can upload a video on YouTube, it can become a means to
  spread false information and rage. Viewers themselves may not distinguish the
  negative context in the video. Most of them are immune from hiding the extreme
  sentiment. We got the following results over years looking at the title of the
  video: The large number of neutral titles is due to two main reasons:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The assumption that we made where titles with 'compound' value between 0.5
    and -0.5 are considered neutral. The higher the margin, the larger the
    number of neutral headlines.
  </li>
  <li>The titles of the video usually meant to be neutral.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  We at this point are not sure if the hate is paid. For that we need to do the
  exact matching for each year with the equal author setting like duration and
  category. The are some
</p>

<b>-figure goes here-</b>

<h3 class="analysis-question">
  Does the category precisely describe the video? How are the videos and
  categories connected?
</h3>

<p>
  YouTube has always fascinated us with its incredibly vast library of content
  that rapidly changes over years. Trying to zoom out and visualize the content
  ecosystem as a whole may help us to derive the proper conclusion out of the
  platform and creators there. Seeing the broad scope of communities and
  connections at scale may also be a powerful tool for understanding online
  behavior. We are aware that the category attribute is too broad and consists
  of various topics. However, choosing the right category will help in promotion
  of your video to the target audience. Nevertheless, we use YouTube tags that
  are words and phrases used to give YouTube context about a video. Moreover,
  tags are considered an important ranking factor in YouTube's search algorithm.
  So, we decided to dive into the tags to be able to explore the topic space of
  Youtube more precisely.
</p>

<br />
<hr />
<br />

<h5>Word Clouds</h5>

<p>Let's look at the most popular tags for some years.</p>

<b>-figure goes here-</b>

<p>
  We are taking into account the most viewed videos that show us the main topics
  for each year. WordCloud shows us pretty interesting results. The hottest
  topics over the years seem to be Funny, Music, News, Comedy.
</p>

<p>
  We want to compare our results to the search in YouTube with GoogleTrends. And
  see the supply and demand.
</p>

<b>-figure with google trend goes here-</b>

<p>
  For the "Funny" tag we can see that it was a big part of Youtube since 2006
  and remained extremely popular for all time periods. But looking at the search
  tendency, it becomes obvious that people's interest in it is constantly
  decreasing. Regarding "Music", we can observe that roughly speaking, the
  search and posting videos tendencies overlap, and the peak in 2011 is common
  for searching and posting. For "News", the tendency is that content (increased
  in 2017) is trying to follow the demand (started in 2016) we can see in
  searches. The first demand, then supply. Looking at the "Comedy" tag, a lot of
  content was produced far earlier (since 2006), then people started to search
  for it (2017).
</p>

<br />

<br />

<h5>Graph</h5>
<br />
<h6 style="color: dimgray">What would an atlas of YouTube look like?</h6>

<p>
  Replicating the process for YouTube, a much larger platform, was no easy task.
  Since we are discovering trends, we would like to consider only 1% of YouTube
  videos per year ranked by view count, which is reasonable due to the extremely
  high amount of videos uploaded each year and variety of categories among this
  1%. We found our answer by looking at the graph that consists of nodes as
  videos and edges as common tags. By collecting these tags and comparing them
  across all videos, we could build a graph of video relationships.
</p>

<b>-figure with graph goes here-</b>

<p>How to read this graph:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Each node is a single video</li>
  <li>There is an edge between two videos if they have common tags</li>
  <li>
    The color of the nodes represents the community of the videos made by the
    Louvain algorithm
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The atlas shows the top 1% YouTube videos per year ranked by view count. What
  insights would this type of visualization hold?
</p>

<p>
  Exploring the centrality of the 3 largest graph components we might find the
  most viewed videos of the specific year. Here we have the most important node
  in each community:
</p>

</ul>

<br />
<hr />
<br />


<h5>Circle Graph</h5>

<p>
  We wonder if the videos are described in both tags and categories but the most
  explicit is the information of the tag: how the categories are connected among
  each other in terms of tags?
</p>
<b>-figure with circle graph goes here-</b>
<p>
  Using the previous graph with the strongly connected videos, we displayed the
  following plots of interaction between the categories. Where the node is the
  category, and the size of the node is proportional to the number of videos in
  this category. The circle graph is weighted and depends on the number of
  connections.
</p>

<p>The results tell us much about the content of the platform.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In 2009, having only three components in the graph, the relation between
    categories is highly weighted and frequent. Which can be described by the
    amount of connected videos in the largest component.
  </li>
  <li>
    In 2012, there was a transparent transition from 2009 in the sense of the
    division into components but with remaining the relation between categories.
    We believe that there are components that contain many categories, which
    gives us the confirmation of interconnected decentralization
  </li>
  <li>
    In 2015 there are more disconnected components and less interaction between
    categories, which gives us thoughts of a mixture of different topics inside
    the specific category that aren't associated with each other and further
    categories. Here we can observe poorly connected decentralization.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally
  it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That
  beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you
  touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to
  change a man.
